# LEGO BYU Maeser Building Assembly

**Objective**: Design a LEGO abstraction of the BYU Maeser Building that represents its key architectural elements while adhering to LEGO system constraints.

## Concept Sketches

I began this project by walking around the Maeser Building, noting key features and general proportions (e.g., the building's rear steps are wider then those at the front), see left of figure below. Then I devised a general assembly strategy, breaking the build up into vertical sections and repeated subassemblies, see right of figure below.

## Modeling in SOLIDWORKS

I modeled all basic LEGO plates and bricks using SOLIDWORKS design tables, enabling quick and easy creation of subsequent configurations and reducing the number of part files needed. Then, I assembled and rendered the build in SOLIDWORKS, see figure below.
